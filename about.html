        <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
        <p>We are glad to introduce you to the Nepal Mountain Lovers Treks and Expedition Pvt. Ltd that provides you
            withvarieties of adventure trip, trekking, peak climbing, hiking, cultural and historical tour, sightseeing,
            challenging white water rafting and wildlife/jungle safari for individuals, families and groups and
            professionals.<br><br>

            Nepal Mountain Lovers Treks and Expedition is managed by the specialized trekking leaders and tour guides
            with many years of accumulated tourism experience. It provides you with your own language speaking guides that
            are qualified to organize wide range of activities throughout Nepal, China, Tibet, Bhutan and India.<br><br>

            As committed to meet the wishes and excitements of the tourists, we offer also the monsoon treks in the
            most shade areas like Mustang and Dolpo in Nepal and Mount Kailash in Tibet and the most beautiful unclouded
            routes that are yet to be well attended.<br><br>

            Considering the requirements of the tourists and their holiday, we design different tour packages
            throughout the year. As there are difficulties to view the beautiful snowcapped mountains in monsoon, we make culture
            tours, short treks and some easy raftings at that time. In the higher elevation where there is very less or
            no monsoon like Dolpo, Upper Mustang and Mount Kailash, we offer longer trek and in the low elevation with
            heavy monsoon, we offer culture tours and short treks even in the monsoon.<br><br>

            We make available the very simple hotels and home stay in the remote villages for our guests to get a quite
            new experience. Based on the interest of the tourists, we provide also the two - five star hotels in the
            capital and other touristy cities. Upon the demand of our guests, we provide very simple and cheap hotels in the
            main touristy cities of Nepal.<br><br>

            We organize budget to deluxe tours consedering the requirement and budget of the guests.<br><br>

            Our packages include rescue missions in case of emergency. With the great sense of safety and comfort of our
            guests, we use carefully maintained and well furnished trekking and tour equipments.<br><br>

            We take pride to provide our guests with the most excellent services at the reasonable cost. We will be
            honored to design an itinerary for your Nepal trip that ensures your satisfaction and safety.<br><br>

            Our priorities:<br><br>

            Provide accurate information in advance regarding your trip<br>
            Introduce and promote the new touristic routes and areas<br>
            Promote gender-balanced human resource in tourism<br>
            Promote tourism by promoting the cultural and environment and protect the world heritage sites<br>
            Share some amount of profit with poor people in remote areas as we know very well the poverty, the lack of
            access of people to basic services and multiple discriminations in the remote places</p>
